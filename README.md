# W207final_hx_nr_cg

This repository contains the original work of Chet Gutwein, Noah Randolph, and Harry Xu. All files are part of a final project for the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) Master of Information and Data Science "Applied Machine Learning" course (W207) completed in Fall 2017.

The objective of the project was to create a model using the Kaggle dataset for Facial Keypoint Recognition. We used the Kaggle scoring function for this challenge to evaluate our results (https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection).
